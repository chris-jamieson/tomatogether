# Tomatogether
A simple shared pomodoro timer, built with Meteor. [Try it out at tomatogether.com](http://www.tomatogether.com).

## Why
Pomodoros are a great technique for getting things done, but they're pointless if you're always getting interrupted in the middle of your flow. If your team shares your pomodoro timers all together in one place, you can see when is the next time your teammate's timer is up, so you can safely interrupt her.

## Make it better
It's pretty basic right now in terms of functionality, so please help improve it. Here's how:

- suggest new features / improvements and upvote other suggestions on the [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/OwmJc0dQ/tomatogether)
- submit issues or pull requests in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jamiesoncj/tomatogether)
