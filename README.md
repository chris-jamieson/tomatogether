# Tomatogether
A simple shared pomodoro timer, built with Meteor

## Why
Pomodoros are a great technique for getting things done, but they're pointless if you're always getting interrupted in the middle of your flow. If your team shares your pomodoro timers all together in one place, you can see when is the next time your teammate's timer is up, so you can safely interrupt her.
